# Osteoporosis Care Plan Guidelines

## Source
RACGP and Healthy Bones Australia Guideline for Osteoporosis Management and Fracture Prevention (3rd Edition, March 2024)

## Who to Screen
- Post-menopausal women and men >50 years with major risk factors
- Anyone >50 with minimal trauma fracture (presumptive diagnosis of osteoporosis)
- Not population-based screening - use clinical risk factor assessment

## Risk Assessment Tools
- **FRAX**: 10-year fracture risk calculator (includes BMD if available)
- **Garvan Calculator**: Alternative, includes falls as input factor
- DXA indicated if FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk >10%

## Diagnosis: T-Score Thresholds
| Classification | T-Score |
|----------------|---------|
| Normal | ≥ -1.0 |
| Osteopenia | -1.0 to -2.5 |
| Osteoporosis | ≤ -2.5 |
| Severe osteoporosis | ≤ -2.5 with fragility fracture |

## Treatment Thresholds
Start pharmacotherapy if:
- T-score ≤ -2.5, OR
- T-score -1.5 to -2.5 with FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥20% and/or hip fracture risk ≥3%

## "Very High" Fracture Risk (Consider Osteoanabolic First)
- Recent fracture with FRAX ≥30%
- Fracture within past 12 months
- T-score < -3.0
- Multiple fractures while on therapy
- FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥30% or hip fracture risk >4.5%

## Key Management Areas

### Strengthen and Protect Bones
- Weight-bearing exercise (walking, jogging, dancing, stair climbing)
- Resistance/strength training (≥2x weekly, progressive loading)
- Healthy diet - ensure optimal calcium intake
- Vitamin D optimal (target >50 nmol/L), supplement if deficient
- Smoking cessation
- Alcohol moderation

### Reduce Risk of Falls
- Home safety assessment and modifications
- Balance training and exercises (e.g., tai chi)
- Optimise vision - regular eye checks
- Medication review - reduce sedatives, review antihypertensives
- Appropriate footwear
- Mobility aids if needed

### Calcium and Vitamin D
- **Calcium**: 1,300 mg/day (women >50, men >70); prioritise dietary sources
- **Vitamin D**: Target serum 25-OH-D >50 nmol/L; supplement 800-1,000 IU daily if needed
- **Protein**: 1-1.2 g/kg body weight daily (especially for frail individuals)
- Supplements most effective when given to those who are deficient

### Monitor and Manage
- Bone density scans (DXA) to track progress and guide medication choice
- Clinical review 3-6 months after starting treatment
- Review every 6-12 months for adherence and side effects
- Height measurement at each visit (loss may indicate vertebral fracture)
- Repeat DXA based on individual risk and treatment response
- Consider treatment break after 5-10 years if T-score ≥ -2.5 and no recent fractures

## Pharmacological Treatment

### Antiresorptive Agents (First-Line)
- **Bisphosphonates**: Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate
- **Denosumab**: RANKL inhibitor; must not be interrupted - requires transition to 12+ months bisphosphonate if stopping

### Osteoanabolic Agents (Very High Risk)
- **Romosozumab**: Dual mechanism; avoid if history of MI/stroke; specialist initiation
- **Teriparatide**: Max 18 months; can be continued by GP after specialist initiation

### Hormone Therapy
- Menopausal hormone therapy within 10 years of menopause (weigh CVD risks)
- SERMs (e.g., raloxifene) for vertebral fracture-predominant osteoporosis

### Important: Denosumab Cessation
- Never stop abruptly - risk of rebound vertebral fractures
- Must transition to 12+ months oral bisphosphonate or zoledronate infusion(s)

## Secondary Causes to Consider
- Corticosteroid use
- Hyperthyroidism / Hyperparathyroidism
- Coeliac disease / Inflammatory bowel disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Early menopause / Hypogonadism
- Aromatase inhibitor or androgen deprivation therapy

## Typical Allied Health Referrals
- Physiotherapist - strength and balance program
- Exercise physiologist - structured progressive resistance program
- Dietitian - calcium-rich diet planning
- Occupational therapist - home safety assessment
- Falls prevention clinic

## Specialist Referral Criteria
- Very high fracture risk (for osteoanabolic therapy initiation)
- Treatment failure or new fractures on therapy
- Complex secondary causes
- Unusual presentations
- Young patients with osteoporosis

## Patient Self-Management Goals (Examples)
- Perform weight-bearing exercise most days
- Do balance exercises and resistance training regularly
- Ensure adequate calcium intake through diet
- Take vitamin D supplements as recommended
- Take osteoporosis medication as prescribed
- Make home safer (remove trip hazards, improve lighting)
- Have regular eye checks
- Avoid smoking and limit alcohol
- Report any new back pain or height loss

## Red Flags
- New or worsening back pain (possible vertebral fracture)
- Height loss >2cm
- Fall with injury
- Atypical femur pain (possible bisphosphonate-related fracture)
- Jaw pain or dental issues on antiresorptives (rare osteonecrosis - MRONJ)
- Missed denosumab dose (urgent - risk of rebound fractures)
