## CKD Staging

| Stage | eGFR (mL/min/1.73m²) | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| G1 | ≥90 | Normal or high (with kidney damage markers) |
| G2 | 60-89 | Mildly decreased |
| G3a | 45-59 | Mildly-moderately decreased |
| G3b | 30-44 | Moderately-severely decreased |
| G4 | 15-29 | Severely decreased |
| G5 | <15 | Kidney failure |

Albuminuria Categories:
- A1: Normal (<3 mg/mmol)
- A2: Moderately increased (3-30 mg/mmol)
- A3: Severely increased (>30 mg/mmol)

## Key Management Areas

### Blood Pressure Control
- Target: <130/80 mmHg (or <120/75 if tolerated and albuminuria)
- First-line: ACE inhibitor or ARB (especially if albuminuria)
- Often requires multiple agents

### RAAS Inhibition
- ACE inhibitor or ARB for all patients with albuminuria
- Reduces proteinuria and slows progression
- Monitor potassium and creatinine after starting

### SGLT2 Inhibitors
- Recommended for CKD with eGFR >20 (regardless of diabetes)
- Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin
- Cardiovascular and kidney protection
- Expect initial eGFR dip (acceptable)

### Cardiovascular Risk
- CKD is a CVD risk equivalent
- Aggressive lipid management (statin therapy)
- Aspirin only for secondary prevention

### Diabetes Management (if applicable)
- SGLT2 inhibitor preferred (dual benefit)
- Metformin: adjust dose for eGFR, avoid if <30
- GLP-1 RA safe in CKD

### Medication Review
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs: NSAIDs, aminoglycosides
- Dose-adjust renally cleared medications
- Review contrast media exposure

### Lifestyle
- Sodium restriction (<2g/day)
- Protein: not severely restricted unless advanced CKD
- Maintain healthy weight
- Smoking cessation
- Physical activity as tolerated

### Monitoring Schedule
- eGFR and uACR: 3-6 monthly (depending on stage)
- Blood pressure: every visit
- Potassium, bicarbonate: 3-6 monthly
- Haemoglobin: annually (more often if anaemic)
- Calcium, phosphate, PTH: stage 4-5

## Nephrology Referral Criteria
- eGFR <30 (or declining rapidly)
- uACR >30 mg/mmol (severely increased albuminuria)
- Sustained eGFR decline >5 mL/min/year
- Uncontrolled hypertension despite 3+ agents
- Haematuria with proteinuria
- Suspected glomerulonephritis

## Typical Allied Health Referrals
- Dietitian - renal diet, sodium/potassium management
- Diabetes educator - if diabetic nephropathy
- Exercise physiologist - safe exercise program
- Pharmacist - medication review, dose adjustments

## Patient Self-Management Goals (Examples)
- Take blood pressure medications daily
- Monitor blood pressure at home
- Follow low-sodium eating plan
- Avoid NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen)
- Stay hydrated (but not excessively)
- Attend regular blood tests
- Report swelling, fatigue, or reduced urine output

## Red Flags
- Rapid eGFR decline (>5 mL/min/year)
- Severe hyperkalaemia (K+ >6.0)
- Fluid overload
- Uraemic symptoms (nausea, confusion, itch)
- New or worsening anaemia
