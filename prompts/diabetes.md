## Key Management Areas

### Glycaemic Control
- HbA1c target: Generally ≤7% (53 mmol/mol), individualised based on:
  - Duration of diabetes
  - Life expectancy
  - Hypoglycaemia risk
  - Comorbidities
- Monitoring: HbA1c every 3-6 months

### Cardiovascular Risk
- All patients with T2DM have elevated CVD risk
- Blood pressure target: <130/80 mmHg (or <120/75 if tolerated)
- Lipid targets: LDL <1.8 mmol/L for high risk
- Consider SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA for cardiovascular protection

### Kidney Health
- Annual screening: eGFR and uACR
- SGLT2 inhibitor for kidney protection (if eGFR >20)
- ACE inhibitor or ARB if albuminuria present

### Eye Health
- Retinal screening at diagnosis, then every 2 years (annually if retinopathy)
- Referral to ophthalmologist if any retinopathy detected

### Foot Care
- Annual foot examination (sensation, pulses, skin)
- Podiatry referral for high-risk feet
- Patient education on daily foot inspection

### Weight Management
- Target: 5-10% weight loss if overweight/obese
- Consider GLP-1 RA for weight management benefit
- Dietitian referral for medical nutrition therapy

### Mental Health
- Screen for diabetes distress and depression
- Higher rates of depression in T2DM
- Psychological support if needed

## Typical Allied Health Referrals
- Dietitian (diabetes educator) - MNT and carbohydrate management
- Podiatrist - foot assessment and care
- Exercise physiologist - structured exercise program
- Diabetes educator - self-management support
- Ophthalmologist/optometrist - retinal screening

## Patient Self-Management Goals (Examples)
- Monitor blood glucose as recommended
- Take medications as prescribed
- Attend regular foot checks
- Check feet daily for wounds or changes
- Maintain healthy eating pattern
- Achieve target physical activity (150 min/week moderate intensity)
- Attend annual cycle of care appointments

## Red Flags Requiring Urgent Action
- HbA1c >10% with symptoms
- New foot ulcer or infection
- Rapid vision changes
- eGFR declining rapidly
- Recurrent hypoglycaemia
