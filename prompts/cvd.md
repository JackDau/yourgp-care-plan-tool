# Cardiovascular Disease Care Plan Guidelines

## Source
2023 Australian Guideline for Assessing and Managing Cardiovascular Disease Risk (Heart Foundation/RACGP endorsed)

## Key Management Areas

### Risk Assessment
- Use Aus CVD Risk Calculator for primary prevention
- Risk categories:
  - Low: <5% 5-year risk
  - Intermediate: 5-<10% 5-year risk
  - High: ≥10% 5-year risk
- Automatic high risk: existing CVD, diabetes with target organ damage, CKD stage 3+, familial hypercholesterolaemia

### Blood Pressure Management
- Target: <140/90 mmHg general, <130/80 mmHg if tolerated or high risk
- First-line: ACE inhibitor, ARB, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide diuretic
- Home BP monitoring recommended

### Lipid Management
- Target LDL:
  - High risk: <1.8 mmol/L (or 50% reduction)
  - Intermediate: <2.5 mmol/L
- Statin therapy for intermediate-high risk
- Consider ezetimibe if target not achieved

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- Aspirin for secondary prevention (established CVD)
- Generally NOT recommended for primary prevention (bleeding risk)

### Lifestyle Modification
- Smoking cessation (most important modifiable factor)
- Physical activity: 150-300 min moderate intensity/week
- Healthy diet: Mediterranean-style, reduced sodium
- Alcohol: Limit to ≤10 standard drinks/week
- Weight: Target BMI <25, or 5-10% loss if overweight

### Diabetes Screening
- Screen for diabetes if not already diagnosed
- Tight glucose control if diabetic

## Typical Allied Health Referrals
- Dietitian - heart-healthy eating, weight management
- Exercise physiologist - cardiac rehabilitation, structured exercise
- Smoking cessation service - Quitline, pharmacotherapy support
- Psychologist - stress management, behaviour change

## Cardiac Rehabilitation
- Strongly recommended for all patients with established CVD
- Exercise training, education, psychological support
- Reduces mortality and hospital readmissions

## Patient Self-Management Goals (Examples)
- Take medications as prescribed
- Monitor blood pressure at home
- Achieve smoke-free status
- Increase physical activity to 30 min most days
- Follow heart-healthy eating pattern
- Reduce alcohol intake to within guidelines
- Attend cardiac rehabilitation if applicable
- Know warning signs of heart attack/stroke

## Medications for Secondary Prevention
- Antiplatelet (aspirin, clopidogrel)
- Statin (high intensity)
- ACE inhibitor or ARB
- Beta-blocker (post-MI or heart failure)

## Red Flags (Call 000)
- Chest pain or pressure lasting >10 minutes
- Pain radiating to arm, jaw, back
- Shortness of breath with chest discomfort
- Facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty (stroke)
