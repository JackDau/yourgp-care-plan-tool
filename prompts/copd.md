# COPD Care Plan Guidelines

## Source
COPD-X Plan: Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for the Management of COPD (Version 2.78, 2025)

## Key Management Areas (COPD-X Framework)

### C - Confirm Diagnosis
- Spirometry is gold standard (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7)
- Classify severity by FEV1 % predicted and symptom burden
- Assess for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency if early onset

### O - Optimise Function
- Bronchodilator therapy (SABA, LAMA, LABA as appropriate)
- Inhaler technique review at every visit
- Pulmonary rehabilitation (Grade A evidence)
- Optimise nutrition

### P - Prevent Deterioration
- Smoking cessation (most important intervention)
- Vaccinations: Influenza (annual), Pneumococcal, COVID-19, RSV (if ≥60)
- Early treatment of exacerbations
- Avoid respiratory irritants

### D - Develop Support Network and Self-Management
- Written COPD action plan
- Education on recognising exacerbation
- Anxiety and depression screening (common comorbidities)
- Advance care planning for severe disease

### X - Manage Exacerbations
- Action plan for early recognition and treatment
- Prednisolone and antibiotics as appropriate
- When to seek urgent medical care

## COPD Action Plan Components
1. How to recognise worsening symptoms
2. When to start rescue medications
3. When to contact GP
4. When to go to emergency department

## Typical Allied Health Referrals
- Pulmonary rehabilitation program - exercise and education
- Respiratory physiotherapist - breathing techniques, secretion clearance
- Dietitian - nutritional support (especially if underweight)
- Occupational therapist - energy conservation, ADL support
- Psychologist - anxiety/depression management

## Patient Self-Management Goals (Examples)
- Stop smoking / remain smoke-free
- Use inhalers correctly (demonstrate technique)
- Follow COPD action plan when symptoms worsen
- Attend pulmonary rehabilitation program
- Stay up to date with vaccinations
- Stay active within limits
- Maintain healthy weight

## Medications
- SABA (salbutamol) - reliever
- LAMA (tiotropium) - maintenance
- LABA (salmeterol, formoterol) - maintenance
- ICS - only if frequent exacerbations or asthma overlap
- Avoid oral corticosteroid maintenance

## Red Flags
- Severe breathlessness at rest
- Cyanosis
- Confusion or drowsiness
- Unable to speak in sentences
- Not responding to reliever medication
