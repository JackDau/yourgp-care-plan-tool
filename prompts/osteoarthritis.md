# Osteoarthritis Care Plan Guidelines

## Source
RACGP Guideline for the Management of Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis (2nd Edition, 2018, NHMRC endorsed)

## Key Principles
- OA is a chronic condition requiring long-term management
- Non-pharmacological treatment is first-line
- Weight loss and exercise have strong evidence base
- Avoid opioids (strong recommendation against)

## Key Management Areas

### Weight Management (STRONG RECOMMENDATION)
- Target: 5-10% weight loss if overweight/obese
- Single most effective intervention for knee OA
- Reduces pain, improves function, slows progression
- Dietitian referral recommended

### Exercise (STRONG RECOMMENDATION)
- Land-based exercise strongly recommended
- Types for knee OA:
  - Muscle strengthening (quadriceps)
  - Walking
  - Tai Chi
  - Stationary cycling
  - Hatha yoga
- Types for hip OA:
  - Muscle strengthening
  - Walking
  - Aquatic exercise
- Frequency: Most days, at least 3x/week
- Physiotherapy or exercise physiology referral

### Self-Management Education
- Understanding OA (it's not "wear and tear")
- Activity pacing
- Joint protection strategies
- Appropriate use of aids/supports

### Pharmacological Management

**Recommended:**
- Paracetamol - try first, modest benefit
- Topical NSAIDs - for knee OA, fewer side effects
- Oral NSAIDs - short-term, lowest effective dose, consider GI/CV risk

**Conditional:**
- Intra-articular corticosteroid - short-term relief
- Duloxetine - if inadequate response to other options

**NOT Recommended:**
- Opioids (STRONG recommendation AGAINST)
- Glucosamine/chondroitin - insufficient evidence
- Platelet-rich plasma
- Stem cell therapy

### Assistive Devices
- Walking aids (cane, walker) if needed
- Knee braces for alignment issues
- Appropriate footwear
- Occupational therapy for ADL modifications

### Surgical Referral
Consider referral to orthopaedic surgeon when:
- Severe symptoms despite optimal non-surgical management
- Significant functional limitation
- Night pain affecting sleep
- Marked structural changes on imaging

NOT an indication for surgery:
- X-ray changes alone
- Failure to try adequate non-surgical management

## Typical Allied Health Referrals
- Physiotherapist - exercise program, manual therapy
- Exercise physiologist - structured exercise prescription
- Dietitian - weight management
- Occupational therapist - joint protection, assistive devices
- Podiatrist - footwear assessment, orthotics

## Patient Self-Management Goals (Examples)
- Perform prescribed exercises daily
- Achieve 5-10% weight loss over 6-12 months
- Walk for 30 minutes, 5 days per week
- Use joint protection strategies in daily activities
- Apply heat/cold therapy for pain relief
- Pace activities to avoid flare-ups
- Use walking aid when needed

## What NOT to Do
- Rest completely (deconditioning worsens outcomes)
- Use opioids for pain management
- Rely on supplements without evidence
- Request MRI/CT routinely (not needed for diagnosis)
- Delay exercise because of pain

## Pain Management Hierarchy
1. Education + exercise + weight loss (FIRST)
2. Paracetamol (as needed)
3. Topical NSAIDs (knee OA)
4. Oral NSAIDs (short-term, with gastroprotection if needed)
5. Intra-articular steroid (occasional, not repeated)
6. Consider duloxetine
7. Referral to pain specialist if refractory

## Red Flags (Not OA - investigate further)
- Sudden onset severe pain
- Hot, red, swollen joint (septic arthritis, gout)
- Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss)
- Night pain waking from sleep (tumour)
- History of trauma (fracture)
